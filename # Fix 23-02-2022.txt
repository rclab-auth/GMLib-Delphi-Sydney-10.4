Hi, Try this. It works for me.
The problem was the api version (too old on gmlib component)
(see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions )

In your map.html file ( line 15) on \Resources folder:
replace this:
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?v=3.27&client=API_KEY&sensor=false&libraries=weather,panoramio,geometry,drawing,visualization"></script>

for this:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?v=3.47&key=API_KEY&libraries=weather,panoramio,geometry,drawing,visualization"></script>

If you use TWebBrowser on Rio or previus, you get a google api warning that your webbrowser not support javascript.
Add this line on <style> tag (line 9):
.infomsg { display: none; } // to hide google javacript warning

I guess with TChromium it's not necesary.

After the changes on map.html file you need to recomplie the resources
run rc.cmd file and build all projects on your project.

I read On Version 10.4, TWebBrowser have a property SelectedEngine that you can change to Edge (Chromium) (not tested)
